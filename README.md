### Learning Notes

##### To execute .sh
* In order to execute file.sh using `./`: Use `chmod +x file.sh`. 

&nbsp;

##### echo
* Single Quotes `'`: display as what it is 
* Double Quotes `"`: display as a string with variables subbed. 

&nbsp;

##### Pipe vs redirection
* Redirection is (mostly) for files (you redirect streams to/from files).
* Piping is for processes: you pipe (redirect) streams from one process to another.
